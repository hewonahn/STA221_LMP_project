# STA221_LMP_project

This repository contains the code and dataset used by our team to predict electricity prices in California for the STA 221 Project. It includes Jupyter Notebook files that cover the entire workflow, including dataset collection, merging datasets, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models using LSTM and SARIMA. The repository provides datasets that were collected, merged, and prepared for training, testing, and prediction purposes.
Additionally, due to GitHub's file size restrictions, the datasets have been compressed into ZIP files for easier storage and sharing.

Note: Some of the raw collected data files are larger than 25MB even after compression, so they could not be uploaded to this repository. 

__Structure__:

- LMP_Raw_Collection:
This folder contains data collected from various sources to gather the necessary information for our analysis. These raw datasets are foundation for merging and analysis steps.

- LMP_Data_Merge:
This folder details the process of merging the collected datasets to create the final dataset used for analysis and modeling.

- LMP_EDA:
This section contains a notebook that conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the final collected dataset. It includes visualizations and descriptive statistics to prepare the data for modeling.

- LMP_LSTM_SARIMA:
This folder contains the implementation of the LSTM and SARIMA models used for predicting electricity prices. Both models were tuned to capture different aspects of price patterns and trends.
